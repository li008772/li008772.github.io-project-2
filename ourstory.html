   Hi! my name is wangfan li and I'm currently a computer science/psychology double major in my fourth year, with plans to go to graduate school.

   what you are seeing here is a web development class project 
   that took about weeks to finish, the majority of the tools we used are just plain javascript/html/css, though we did use JQuery a little to help 
   getting data from outside sources.
   what made this possible though are leaflet.js and openAqi, leaflet is the framework for the map while openAqi provides us with air quality data over the said
   map. And locationIq API also helped by provding you with the means to search a location by just entering its name.
