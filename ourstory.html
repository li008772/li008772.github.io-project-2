   Hi! my name is wangfan li and I'm currently a computer science/psychology double major in my fourth year, with plans to go to graduate school.
   <br>  
   <br>
   what you are seeing here is a web development class project 
   that took about weeks to finish, the majority of the tools we used are just plain javascript/html/css, though we did use JQuery a little to help 
   getting data from outside sources.
   what made this possible though are leaflet.js and openAqi, leaflet is the framework for the map while openAqi provides us with air quality data over the said
   map. And locationIq API also helped by provding you with the means to search a location by just entering its name.

		Hi, my name is Ryan Jasperson and I'm a senior here at St. Thomas. I'm looking to graduate this spring with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

		As Wangfan explained above, the project was developed mostly using vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Some jQuery was used for AJAX as well as editting HTML elements. We were able to use the Leaflet API to make a clean heatmap within the application's map.
		Along with the OpenAQ API and Leaflet API, we also used a Haversine formula derived from Rosetta Code in order to seemlessly calculate the distance from point A to point B on a sphere.
		By combining the OpenAQ API functionality with the Haversine formula, it was much easier to get accurate results in terms of distances and data.
